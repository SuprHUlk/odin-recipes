            <p>Chicken jerky? Who knew? And who knew you could make jerky in an air fryer?</p>
            <p>Plan ahead for this spicy snack as the chicken needs time to marinate and air-fry.</p>

            <h2 class="heading two">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="table">
                <li>2 (5 ounce) boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
                <li>½ cup mojo criollo marinade (such as Goya®)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning</li>
                <li>6 wooden skewers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading two">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="table"> 
                <li>Combine chicken strips, marinade, and Cajun seasoning in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li>Measure skewers to fit across the air fryer basket, slightly overlapping the edge. Trim off excess length.</li>
                <li>Preheat the air fryer to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Thread chicken strips onto skewers, leaving room in between each strip, while the air fryer is preheating.</li>
                <li>Air fry for 1 hour 15 minutes. Adjust cooking time as most air fryers have a maximum setting of 30 minutes. Rearrange the skewers during the reset time.</li>
                <li>Increase temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and air fry for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove strips to a paper towel-lined storage container. Seal. Allow to rest overnight before serving.</li>
